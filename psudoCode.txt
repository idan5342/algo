create a new array of the following form:
[
    {
        time: item.StartTime
        type: "Start"
        ...item (without StopTime)
    },
    {
        time: item.StopTime
        type: "Stop"
        ...item (without StartTime)
    },
    ... (same for each item)
]

we will call this array Times

sort Times by time.

now we have the brackets problem with a little complication

make a empty array called Relevent.
create a new variable ActiveItem and set it to null.
make a new array (called Result) from Times by the following logic:
if (item.type === "start") {
    if (ActiveItem is null)
        ActiveItem = item
        ActiveItem.StartTime = item.time
        continue to the next item

    check level:
    if (item.level <= ActiveItem.level)
        Relevent.push(item)
        continue to the next item

    if (item.level > ActiveItem.level)
            Relevent.push(ActiveItem with StartTime = item.time)
            ActiveItem.StopTime = item.time
            Result.push(ActiveItem)
            ActiveItem = item
            ActiveItem.StartTime = item.time
            continue to the next item
} 
else (item.type === "stop") {
    check Relevent:
    if (there is an item in Relevent that has the same id as item.id) {
        make a full item (with StartTime and StopTime) and put it in the last item of Result in a field called Owners that is an array
        check each item 
        if (last item in Result is without StopTime) {
            remove this item from Relevent using id
        } else (with StopTime) {
            make a partial item that has the StartTime = last item in Result.StopTime and the StopTime of item, add this partial item to Result
            remove this item from Relevent using id
        }
    }
    if the item.id is not in Relevent then it surely the StopTime of the last item in Result:
    edit the last item in Result to have a StopTime that is item.time
    take the first item in Relevent and put it in Result (as needed with StartTime instead of time)

}
